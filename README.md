# XNOEdit

An in-progress graphical viewer/editor for .XNO files from Sonic the Hedgehog (2006) for the Xbox 360.

This project aims to be able to view all objects from Sonic '06 using their original, recompiled shaders to provide as close to 1:1 accuracy as possible.
Vulkan, D3D12, and Metal are all supported through WGPU.

Potential future extensions include support for SET files and morph animations.
